    description: "Vitamin B2, also known as riboflavin, is a water-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes in the body. It is essential for energy metabolism, antioxidant defense, and cellular function.",
    functions: {
        "Energy Metabolism": "Vitamin B2 is necessary for the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into energy. It serves as a precursor to coenzymes such as flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), which participate in redox reactions and electron transport chain processes. Riboflavin helps generate and transfer energy from nutrients to cells for vital cellular functions.",
        "Antioxidant Defense": "Vitamin B2 acts as an antioxidant and scavenger of free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells and tissues. It helps protect cells from oxidative damage and inflammation by supporting the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione reductase and peroxidases. Riboflavin also regenerates other antioxidants such as glutathione and vitamins C and E.",
        "Cellular Function": "Vitamin B2 plays a role in various cellular processes, including DNA synthesis, repair, and gene expression. It is involved in the metabolism of amino acids, fatty acids, and sterols, as well as the synthesis of neurotransmitters and hormones. Riboflavin contributes to the maintenance of cell structure, integrity, and membrane function.",
        "Vision Health": "Vitamin B2 may play a role in vision health and eye function, particularly in the maintenance of corneal and retinal tissues. Riboflavin is a component of flavoproteins such as opsin, which are involved in the conversion of light into electrical signals in the retina. Adequate riboflavin levels are important for visual acuity and adaptation to changes in light intensity.",
        "Skin and Hair Health": "Vitamin B2 is important for skin and hair health, contributing to the maintenance of healthy skin texture, hydration, and integrity. It supports the synthesis of collagen and elastin, structural proteins that provide strength and elasticity to skin tissues. Riboflavin may also play a role in hair growth, pigmentation, and follicle health."

    sources: {
        "Dairy Products": "Dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and cheese are rich dietary sources of vitamin B2. They provide riboflavin in significant amounts, along with high-quality protein, calcium, and other essential nutrients.",
        "Meat and Poultry": "Meat and poultry, including beef, pork, chicken, and turkey, are good sources of vitamin B2. They offer riboflavin along with high-quality protein, iron, zinc, and other vitamins and minerals essential for overall health and well-being.",
        "Eggs": "Eggs are a nutritious source of vitamin B2, providing riboflavin in the yolk along with protein, fat, and essential vitamins and minerals. Consuming eggs can help meet daily riboflavin requirements and support overall nutritional status.",
        "Leafy Green Vegetables": "Leafy green vegetables such as spinach, kale, collard greens, and Swiss chard contain vitamin B2 in varying amounts. They are nutrient-dense sources of riboflavin along with dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of vitamin B2 varies by age, sex, and individual health status. For most adults, the recommended amount is approximately 1.1-1.3 milligrams per day for men and 0.9-1.1 milligrams per day for women. Pregnant and lactating women may have slightly higher riboflavin requirements.",
    deficiency: "Vitamin B2 deficiency, known as riboflavin deficiency, is relatively uncommon in developed countries due to the widespread availability of riboflavin-rich foods. However, certain factors such as poor dietary intake, malabsorption disorders, alcoholism, and certain medications may increase the risk of deficiency. Symptoms of riboflavin deficiency may include fatigue, weakness, mouth sores, skin lesions, and vision problems.",
    overdose: "Excessive vitamin B2 intake from dietary sources is generally not associated with adverse effects, as riboflavin is water-soluble and excess amounts are excreted in urine. However, high-dose riboflavin supplements may cause harmless discoloration of urine (yellow-orange coloration). Chronic overconsumption of vitamin B2 supplements is uncommon but should be avoided to prevent potential adverse effects.",
