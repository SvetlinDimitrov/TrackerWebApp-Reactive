    description: "Vitamin B6, also known as pyridoxine, is a water-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes in the body. It is essential for protein metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and immune function.",
    functions: {
        "Protein Metabolism": "Vitamin B6 is necessary for the metabolism of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. It serves as a cofactor for enzymes involved in the transamination, decarboxylation, and deamination of amino acids. Pyridoxine facilitates the conversion of amino acids into other compounds, such as neurotransmitters, hormones, and energy substrates.",
        "Neurotransmitter Synthesis": "Vitamin B6 plays a role in neurotransmitter synthesis and regulation, particularly in the synthesis of serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It serves as a cofactor for enzymes involved in the conversion of precursor molecules into active neurotransmitters. Pyridoxine influences mood, behavior, and cognitive function.",
        "Hemoglobin Synthesis": "Vitamin B6 is involved in hemoglobin synthesis and red blood cell formation, supporting oxygen transport and delivery to tissues. It facilitates the synthesis of heme, the iron-containing component of hemoglobin, and helps regulate iron metabolism. Pyridoxine deficiency may impair hemoglobin production and lead to anemia.",
        "Immune Function": "Vitamin B6 plays a role in immune function and defense mechanisms against infections and diseases. It supports the proliferation and activity of immune cells such as lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages. Pyridoxine enhances antibody production, cytokine secretion, and phagocytosis, contributing to immune surveillance and response.",
        "Gene Expression": "Vitamin B6 influences gene expression and epigenetic modifications by regulating the activity of transcription factors and histone-modifying enzymes. It modulates the expression of genes involved in metabolism, cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Pyridoxine may affect cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue development."

    sources: {
        "Meat and Poultry": "Meat and poultry, including beef, chicken, turkey, and pork, are rich dietary sources of vitamin B6. They provide pyridoxine in significant amounts, along with high-quality protein, iron, zinc, and other essential nutrients.",
        "Fish and Seafood": "Fish and seafood, such as salmon, tuna, mackerel, and shellfish, contain significant amounts of vitamin B6. They offer pyridoxine along with omega-3 fatty acids, which have anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular benefits. Consuming fish can help meet daily vitamin B6 requirements and support overall health.",
        "Whole Grains": "Whole grains such as brown rice, oats, barley, and whole wheat products are good dietary sources of vitamin B6. They provide pyridoxine along with dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals, making them nutritious choices for overall health and well-being.",
        "Legumes and Beans": "Legumes and beans, such as lentils, chickpeas, black beans, and kidney beans, contain vitamin B6 in varying amounts. They offer pyridoxine along with protein, fiber, and other essential nutrients essential for energy metabolism and cellular function."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of vitamin B6 varies by age, sex, and individual health status. For most adults, the recommended amount is approximately 1.3-1.7 milligrams per day. Pregnant and lactating women may have slightly higher pyridoxine requirements.",
    deficiency: "Vitamin B6 deficiency is relatively rare but can occur in individuals with poor dietary intake, malabsorption disorders, alcoholism, or certain medical conditions. Symptoms of pyridoxine deficiency may include fatigue, weakness, irritability, depression, dermatitis, glossitis, and neurological symptoms such as neuropathy and seizures.",
    overdose: "Excessive vitamin B6 intake from dietary sources is generally not associated with adverse effects, as pyridoxine is water-soluble and excess amounts are excreted in urine. However, high-dose vitamin B6 supplements may cause neurological side effects such as sensory neuropathy, numbness, and tingling in the extremities. Chronic overconsumption of pyridoxine supplements should be avoided to prevent potential adverse effects.",
