    description: "Vitamin B7, also known as biotin, is a water-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes in the body. It is essential for metabolism, energy production, and maintaining healthy skin, hair, and nails.",
    functions: {
        "Carbohydrate, Fat, and Protein Metabolism": "Vitamin B7 is necessary for the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into energy. It serves as a cofactor for enzymes involved in key metabolic pathways such as gluconeogenesis, fatty acid synthesis, and amino acid catabolism. Biotin helps convert nutrients into forms that can be utilized by cells for energy production and cellular function.",
        "Gene Expression": "Vitamin B7 influences gene expression and epigenetic modifications by regulating the activity of transcription factors and histone-modifying enzymes. It modulates the expression of genes involved in metabolism, cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Biotin may affect cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue development.",
        "Skin, Hair, and Nail Health": "Vitamin B7 plays a role in maintaining healthy skin, hair, and nails, contributing to their strength, integrity, and appearance. It promotes the synthesis of keratin, a structural protein found in skin, hair, and nails, which helps maintain their texture, elasticity, and moisture balance. Biotin deficiency may lead to skin rashes, hair loss, and brittle nails.",
        "Neurological Function": "Vitamin B7 may play a role in neurological function and brain health, although further research is needed to fully understand its mechanisms of action. Biotin influences neurotransmitter synthesis, nerve signaling, and synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system. Adequate biotin levels are important for cognitive function, mood regulation, and nervous system integrity."

    sources: {
        "Eggs": "Eggs are one of the richest dietary sources of vitamin B7, providing biotin in significant amounts, particularly in the egg yolk. Consuming eggs can help meet daily biotin requirements and support overall nutritional status.",
        "Meat and Poultry": "Meat and poultry, including beef, chicken, turkey, and pork, are rich sources of vitamin B7. They provide biotin along with high-quality protein, iron, zinc, and other essential nutrients essential for overall health and well-being.",
        "Fish and Seafood": "Fish and seafood, such as salmon, tuna, mackerel, and shellfish, contain significant amounts of vitamin B7. They offer biotin along with omega-3 fatty acids, which have anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular benefits. Consuming fish can help meet daily biotin requirements and support overall health.",
        "Nuts and Seeds": "Nuts and seeds, including almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds, and peanuts, are nutrient-dense sources of vitamin B7. They provide biotin along with healthy fats, protein, and micronutrients. Consuming nuts and seeds can help meet daily biotin requirements and support overall nutritional status."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of vitamin B7 varies by age, sex, and individual health status. For most adults, the recommended amount is approximately 30-100 micrograms per day. Pregnant and lactating women may have slightly higher biotin requirements.",
    deficiency: "Vitamin B7 deficiency is relatively rare and usually occurs in individuals with poor dietary intake, malabsorption disorders, or certain medical conditions. Symptoms of biotin deficiency may include thinning hair, brittle nails, dry skin, dermatitis, and neurological symptoms such as depression, lethargy, and tingling sensations in the extremities.",
    overdose: "Excessive vitamin B7 intake from dietary sources is generally not associated with adverse effects, as biotin is water-soluble and excess amounts are excreted in urine. There are no known toxic effects of high-dose biotin supplementation. However, consuming extremely high doses of biotin supplements may interfere with certain laboratory tests, leading to inaccurate results.",
