    description: "Vitamin B5, also known as pantothenic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes in the body. It is essential for energy metabolism, hormone synthesis, and cellular function.",
    functions: {
        "Energy Metabolism": "Vitamin B5 is necessary for the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into energy. It serves as a precursor to coenzyme A (CoA), a cofactor involved in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA, a key intermediate in the citric acid cycle and fatty acid oxidation pathways. Pantothenic acid helps generate and transfer energy from nutrients to cells for vital cellular functions.",
        "Hormone Synthesis": "Vitamin B5 plays a role in hormone synthesis and regulation, particularly in the synthesis of steroid hormones such as cortisol, aldosterone, and sex hormones (estrogen, progesterone, testosterone). Pantothenic acid is a component of CoA, which is required for the synthesis of cholesterol, steroid hormones, and other lipid molecules.",
        "Cellular Function": "Vitamin B5 is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA synthesis, repair, and cell division. It participates in enzymatic reactions required for the synthesis of fatty acids, phospholipids, and sphingolipids, which are essential components of cell membranes. Pantothenic acid contributes to the maintenance of cell structure, integrity, and membrane function.",
        "Stress Response": "Vitamin B5 may play a role in the body's stress response mechanisms by supporting adrenal gland function and cortisol synthesis. Pantothenic acid is involved in the synthesis of coenzyme A, which is necessary for the synthesis of cortisol, the primary stress hormone. Adequate levels of vitamin B5 are important for coping with physical and psychological stressors and maintaining homeostasis during stressful conditions."

    sources: {
        "Animal Products": "Animal products such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy products are rich dietary sources of vitamin B5. They provide pantothenic acid in significant amounts, along with high-quality protein, iron, zinc, and other essential nutrients.",
        "Whole Grains": "Whole grains such as brown rice, oats, barley, and whole wheat products are good dietary sources of vitamin B5. They provide pantothenic acid along with dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals, making them nutritious choices for overall health and well-being.",
        "Legumes and Beans": "Legumes and beans, such as lentils, chickpeas, black beans, and kidney beans, contain vitamin B5 in varying amounts. They offer pantothenic acid along with protein, fiber, and other essential nutrients essential for energy metabolism and cellular function.",
        "Nuts and Seeds": "Nuts and seeds, including sunflower seeds, peanuts, almonds, and walnuts, are nutrient-dense sources of vitamin B5. They provide pantothenic acid along with healthy fats, protein, and micronutrients. Consuming nuts and seeds can help meet daily vitamin B5 requirements and support overall nutritional status."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of vitamin B5 varies by age, sex, and individual health status. For most adults, the recommended amount is approximately 5 milligrams per day. Pregnant and lactating women may have slightly higher pantothenic acid requirements.",
    deficiency: "Vitamin B5 deficiency is rare and typically occurs in conjunction with deficiencies of other B vitamins. Symptoms of pantothenic acid deficiency may include fatigue, weakness, irritability, insomnia, abdominal discomfort, and neurological symptoms. Severe deficiency can lead to a condition called paresthesia, characterized by tingling, numbness, and burning sensations in the extremities.",
    overdose: "Excessive vitamin B5 intake from dietary sources is generally not associated with adverse effects, as pantothenic acid is water-soluble and excess amounts are excreted in urine. There are no known toxic effects of high-dose vitamin B5 supplementation. However, consuming extremely high doses of pantothenic acid supplements may cause gastrointestinal disturbances such as diarrhea.",
