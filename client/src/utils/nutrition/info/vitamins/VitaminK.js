    description: "Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in blood clotting, bone metabolism, and cardiovascular health. There are two primary forms of vitamin K: vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) and vitamin K2 (menaquinone).",
    functions: {
        "Blood Clotting": "Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting and coagulation processes in the body. It serves as a cofactor for enzymes involved in the synthesis of clotting factors, particularly prothrombin (factor II), which is necessary for the formation of fibrin clots. Vitamin K ensures the proper activation and function of clotting proteins, preventing excessive bleeding and hemorrhage.",
        "Bone Metabolism": "Vitamin K plays a role in bone metabolism and mineralization, contributing to bone health and strength. It facilitates the incorporation of calcium into bone matrix proteins such as osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein (MGP), which regulate bone formation, remodeling, and mineralization. Vitamin K deficiency can lead to impaired bone mineralization and an increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures.",
        "Cardiovascular Health": "Vitamin K may have cardioprotective effects and support cardiovascular health by regulating vascular calcification and arterial stiffness. It activates matrix Gla protein (MGP), which inhibits the deposition of calcium in arterial walls and soft tissues, preventing the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Adequate vitamin K intake may help reduce the risk of coronary artery calcification and cardiovascular events."
    },
    sources: {
        "Leafy Green Vegetables": "Leafy green vegetables such as kale, spinach, collard greens, and Swiss chard are rich dietary sources of vitamin K1 (phylloquinone). They provide phylloquinone in significant amounts, along with other nutrients such as fiber, vitamins, and minerals essential for overall health and well-being.",
        "Cruciferous Vegetables": "Cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower contain vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) as well. These vegetables offer phylloquinone along with glucosinolates, sulforaphane, and other bioactive compounds that have anticancer and anti-inflammatory properties. Including cruciferous vegetables in the diet can help boost vitamin K intake.",
        "Fermented Foods": "Fermented foods such as natto, a traditional Japanese dish made from fermented soybeans, are rich dietary sources of vitamin K2 (menaquinone). Natto provides menaquinone-7 (MK-7), a long-chain form of vitamin K2 that has greater bioavailability and longevity in the body compared to other forms. Consuming fermented foods can help increase vitamin K2 levels and support overall nutritional status.",
        "Animal Products": "Animal products such as meat, eggs, and dairy also contain small amounts of vitamin K2 (menaquinone). These foods provide menaquinone in various forms, contributing to overall vitamin K intake. Including a variety of animal products in the diet can help ensure adequate vitamin K2 intake."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of vitamin K varies by age, sex, and individual health status. For most adults, the recommended amount is approximately 90-120 micrograms of vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) per day. Adequate vitamin K2 (menaquinone) intake is less well-established but may range from 50-200 micrograms per day.",
    deficiency: "Vitamin K deficiency is relatively rare but can occur in individuals with poor dietary intake, malabsorption disorders, or certain medical conditions. Symptoms of vitamin K deficiency may include easy bruising, excessive bleeding, nosebleeds, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Severe deficiency can lead to hemorrhagic disorders and impaired wound healing.",
    overdose: "Excessive vitamin K intake from dietary sources and supplements is generally not associated with adverse effects, as vitamin K is well-tolerated and has a low risk of toxicity. There are no established upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamin K, and toxicity is rare even with high-dose supplementation. However, individuals taking anticoagulant medications such as warfarin should consult their healthcare provider before making significant changes to their vitamin K intake.",
