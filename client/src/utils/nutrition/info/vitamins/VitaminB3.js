    description: "Vitamin B3, also known as niacin, is a water-soluble vitamin that plays a critical role in various physiological processes in the body. It is essential for energy metabolism, DNA repair, and cell signaling.",
    functions: {
        "Energy Metabolism": "Vitamin B3 is necessary for the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into energy. It serves as a precursor to coenzymes such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), which participate in redox reactions and electron transport chain processes. Niacin helps generate and transfer energy from nutrients to cells for vital cellular functions.",
        "DNA Repair": "Vitamin B3 plays a role in DNA synthesis, repair, and maintenance, helping ensure the integrity and stability of the genetic material. It participates in enzymatic reactions involved in DNA replication, transcription, and cell division. Niacin may contribute to the prevention of mutations, DNA damage, and carcinogenesis.",
        "Cell Signaling": "Vitamin B3 is involved in cell signaling pathways and communication mechanisms that regulate cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. It modulates the activity of enzymes, receptors, and transcription factors involved in intracellular and intercellular signaling cascades. Niacin influences gene expression, protein synthesis, and cell fate determination.",
        "Lipid Metabolism": "Vitamin B3 affects lipid metabolism and cholesterol synthesis, helping maintain lipid homeostasis and cardiovascular health. It inhibits the synthesis of triglycerides and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) in the liver, leading to decreased serum triglyceride levels. Niacin also increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and improves lipoprotein particle size and composition.",
        "Neurological Function": "Vitamin B3 may play a role in neurological function and brain health, although further research is needed to fully understand its mechanisms of action. Niacin influences neurotransmitter synthesis, nerve signaling, and synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system. Adequate niacin levels are important for cognitive function, mood regulation, and nervous system integrity."

    sources: {
        "Meat and Poultry": "Meat and poultry, including beef, pork, chicken, and turkey, are rich dietary sources of vitamin B3. They provide niacin in the form of nicotinamide and nicotinic acid, along with high-quality protein, iron, zinc, and other vitamins and minerals essential for overall health and well-being.",
        "Fish and Seafood": "Fish and seafood, such as salmon, tuna, mackerel, and shellfish, contain significant amounts of vitamin B3. They offer niacin along with omega-3 fatty acids, which have anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular benefits. Consuming fish can help meet daily niacin requirements and support heart health.",
        "Whole Grains": "Whole grains such as brown rice, oats, barley, and whole wheat products are good dietary sources of vitamin B3. They provide niacin along with dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals, making them nutritious choices for overall health and well-being.",
        "Legumes and Beans": "Legumes and beans, such as lentils, chickpeas, black beans, and kidney beans, contain vitamin B3 in varying amounts. They offer niacin along with protein, fiber, and other essential nutrients essential for energy metabolism and cellular function."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of vitamin B3 varies by age, sex, and individual health status. For most adults, the recommended amount is approximately 14-16 milligrams per day for men and 12-14 milligrams per day for women. Pregnant and lactating women may have slightly higher niacin requirements.",
    deficiency: "Vitamin B3 deficiency, known as niacin deficiency, can lead to a condition called pellagra, which affects multiple systems in the body. Symptoms of pellagra may include the three Ds: dermatitis (skin rash), diarrhea, and dementia (mental confusion). Additional symptoms may include fatigue, weakness, mouth sores, swollen tongue, and psychiatric disturbances.",
    overdose: "Excessive vitamin B3 intake from dietary sources is generally not associated with adverse effects, as niacin is water-soluble and excess amounts are excreted in urine. However, high-dose niacin supplements may cause side effects such as flushing, itching, and liver toxicity. Extended-release niacin supplements may increase the risk of liver damage and other adverse effects.",
