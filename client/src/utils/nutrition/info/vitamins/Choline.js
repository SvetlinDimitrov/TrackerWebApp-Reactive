const choline = {
    description: "Choline is an essential nutrient that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes in the body. It is a precursor to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and a component of cell membranes, phospholipids, and lipoproteins.",
    functions: {
        "Neurotransmitter Synthesis": "Choline is a precursor to acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that plays key roles in memory, cognition, muscle control, and other nervous system functions. Adequate choline levels are necessary for optimal neurotransmitter synthesis and signaling.",
        "Cell Membrane Structure": "Choline is a component of cell membranes and phospholipids, which are essential for maintaining cell structure, integrity, and fluidity. Choline-containing phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine are major constituents of cell membranes throughout the body.",
        "Fat Transport": "Choline is involved in lipid metabolism and fat transport in the body. It facilitates the synthesis and secretion of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) in the liver, which transport triglycerides and cholesterol to peripheral tissues for energy production and storage.",
        "Methylation Reactions": "Choline is a methyl donor in various biochemical pathways, including methylation reactions involved in DNA synthesis, gene expression, and metabolism. It contributes to the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a universal methyl donor critical for epigenetic regulation and cellular processes.",
        "Brain Development": "Choline plays a critical role in brain development and cognitive function, particularly during fetal development and early childhood. Adequate choline intake during pregnancy and infancy is important for proper brain growth, neural tube closure, and memory formation."
    },
    sources: {
        "Eggs": "Eggs are one of the richest dietary sources of choline, providing high levels of this nutrient in the form of phosphatidylcholine and other choline-containing compounds. Eating eggs can help meet daily choline requirements along with essential nutrients such as protein and vitamins.",
        "Meat and Poultry": "Meat and poultry, including beef, pork, chicken, and turkey, are good sources of choline. They provide choline along with high-quality protein, vitamins, and minerals, making them nutritious choices for overall health and well-being.",
        "Seafood": "Seafood, such as fish, shellfish, and crustaceans, contains choline in varying amounts. Fatty fish like salmon, tuna, and mackerel are particularly rich in choline, along with omega-3 fatty acids and other nutrients beneficial for heart and brain health.",
        "Dairy Products": "Dairy products such as milk, cheese, and yogurt naturally contain small amounts of choline, although they are not significant contributors to overall choline intake in most diets. Low-fat or fat-free dairy options are available for individuals seeking to reduce fat and calorie intake."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of choline varies by age, sex, and individual health status. For most adults, the recommended amount is approximately 425-550 milligrams per day for men and 425-450 milligrams per day for women. Pregnant and lactating women may have higher choline requirements.",
    deficiency: "Choline deficiency is rare in healthy individuals with balanced diets, as choline is widely available in many foods. However, certain factors such as inadequate dietary intake, genetic variations, and increased choline needs during pregnancy and lactation may increase the risk of deficiency. Symptoms of choline deficiency may include liver dysfunction, muscle damage, memory impairment, and neural tube defects in infants.",
    overdose: "Excessive choline intake from dietary sources is rare and usually only occurs from chronic supplementation or consumption of choline-rich foods. However, high doses of choline supplements may cause adverse effects such as gastrointestinal disturbances, fishy body odor, and hypotension.",
