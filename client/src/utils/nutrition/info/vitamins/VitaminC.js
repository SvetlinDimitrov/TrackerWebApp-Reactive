    description: "Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes in the body. It is essential for collagen synthesis, antioxidant defense, immune function, and wound healing.",
    functions: {
        "Collagen Synthesis": "Vitamin C is necessary for the synthesis of collagen, a structural protein found in skin, bones, blood vessels, and connective tissues. It serves as a cofactor for enzymes involved in collagen production, cross-linking, and stabilization. Ascorbic acid plays a key role in maintaining the integrity, elasticity, and strength of connective tissues.",
        "Antioxidant Defense": "Vitamin C acts as a powerful antioxidant, scavenging free radicals and reactive oxygen species that can damage cells, DNA, and tissues. It helps protect cells from oxidative stress and inflammation, reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. Ascorbic acid regenerates other antioxidants such as vitamin E, glutathione, and coenzyme Q10.",
        "Immune Function": "Vitamin C plays a critical role in immune function and defense mechanisms against infections and diseases. It supports the proliferation and activity of immune cells such as lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages. Ascorbic acid enhances antibody production, cytokine secretion, and phagocytosis, contributing to immune surveillance and response.",
        "Wound Healing": "Vitamin C is essential for wound healing and tissue repair processes. It stimulates the production of collagen and other extracellular matrix components necessary for the formation of new tissues. Ascorbic acid enhances fibroblast proliferation, angiogenesis, and epithelialization, accelerating the healing of cuts, bruises, burns, and surgical incisions."

    sources: {
        "Citrus Fruits": "Citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons, grapefruits, and limes are well-known dietary sources of vitamin C. They provide ascorbic acid in significant amounts, along with fiber, vitamins, and minerals essential for overall health and well-being.",
        "Berries": "Berries such as strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries are rich sources of vitamin C. They offer ascorbic acid along with antioxidants, flavonoids, and phytonutrients that support immune function and cardiovascular health.",
        "Bell Peppers": "Bell peppers, particularly red and green varieties, are excellent dietary sources of vitamin C. They provide ascorbic acid along with other nutrients such as vitamin A, vitamin K, and potassium. Consuming bell peppers can help meet daily vitamin C requirements and support overall nutritional status.",
        "Leafy Green Vegetables": "Leafy green vegetables such as spinach, kale, Swiss chard, and broccoli are nutrient-dense sources of vitamin C. They offer ascorbic acid along with fiber, vitamins, and minerals essential for energy metabolism and cellular function."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of vitamin C varies by age, sex, and individual health status. For most adults, the recommended amount is approximately 75-90 milligrams per day for women and 90-120 milligrams per day for men. Pregnant and lactating women may require higher doses of ascorbic acid to support fetal development and breastfeeding.",
    deficiency: "Vitamin C deficiency, also known as scurvy, is relatively rare but can occur in individuals with poor dietary intake, malabsorption disorders, or certain medical conditions. Symptoms of vitamin C deficiency may include fatigue, weakness, swollen or bleeding gums, joint pain, and delayed wound healing. Severe deficiency can lead to scurvy, characterized by bleeding gums, skin lesions, anemia, and tooth loss.",
    overdose: "Excessive vitamin C intake from dietary sources and supplements is generally well-tolerated, as ascorbic acid is water-soluble and excess amounts are excreted in urine. However, high-dose vitamin C supplementation may cause gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal cramps in some individuals. Individuals with certain medical conditions such as kidney stones should consult their healthcare provider before taking high-dose vitamin C supplements.",
