    description: "Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin and antioxidant that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes in the body. It is essential for immune function, cell signaling, gene expression, and protection against oxidative stress and inflammation.",
    functions: {
        "Antioxidant Defense": "Vitamin E acts as a potent antioxidant, scavenging free radicals and reactive oxygen species that can damage cells, DNA, and tissues. It helps protect cell membranes, lipids, and proteins from oxidative damage, reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. Vitamin E regenerates other antioxidants such as vitamin C, glutathione, and coenzyme Q10.",
        "Immune Function": "Vitamin E plays a role in immune function and defense mechanisms against infections and diseases. It modulates the activity of immune cells such as T cells, B cells, and macrophages, enhancing their ability to recognize and eliminate pathogens. Vitamin E also regulates the production of cytokines and inflammatory mediators, contributing to immune surveillance and response.",
        "Cell Signaling and Gene Expression": "Vitamin E is involved in cell signaling pathways and gene expression processes that regulate cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. It influences the activity of enzymes, transcription factors, and signaling molecules involved in cellular homeostasis, proliferation, and survival. Vitamin E may play a role in the prevention of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic conditions.",
        "Neurological Function": "Vitamin E is essential for neurological function and nerve health, playing a role in nerve signaling, myelin sheath formation, and neurotransmitter synthesis. It protects nerve cells from oxidative damage and inflammation, maintaining optimal cognitive function and mental health. Vitamin E deficiency may contribute to neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease."

    sources: {
        "Nuts and Seeds": "Nuts and seeds such as almonds, sunflower seeds, hazelnuts, and peanuts are excellent dietary sources of vitamin E. They provide alpha-tocopherol, the most biologically active form of vitamin E, along with unsaturated fats, fiber, and other essential nutrients. Consuming nuts and seeds regularly can help meet daily vitamin E requirements and support overall nutritional status.",
        "Vegetable Oils": "Vegetable oils such as sunflower oil, safflower oil, wheat germ oil, and olive oil are rich sources of vitamin E. They provide alpha-tocopherol and other tocopherol isoforms, which serve as antioxidants and contribute to the stability of cell membranes and lipid metabolism. Using vegetable oils in cooking and salad dressings can increase vitamin E intake.",
        "Leafy Green Vegetables": "Leafy green vegetables such as spinach, kale, Swiss chard, and broccoli are nutrient-dense sources of vitamin E. They offer alpha-tocopherol and other phytonutrients such as carotenoids, flavonoids, and polyphenols that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Including leafy greens in the diet can help boost vitamin E levels and promote overall health.",
        "Fortified Foods": "Fortified foods such as breakfast cereals, margarine, and fruit juices are often enriched with synthetic vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol acetate). These fortified foods can help individuals meet their daily vitamin E requirements, especially in populations with limited access to natural food sources."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of vitamin E varies by age, sex, and individual health status. For most adults, the recommended amount is approximately 15 milligrams of alpha-tocopherol per day. Pregnant and lactating women may require slightly higher doses of vitamin E to support fetal development and breastfeeding.",
    deficiency: "Vitamin E deficiency is relatively rare but can occur in individuals with poor dietary intake, malabsorption disorders, or certain medical conditions. Symptoms of vitamin E deficiency may include muscle weakness, vision problems, impaired immune function, and neurological symptoms such as neuropathy and ataxia. Severe deficiency can lead to neurological disorders and reproductive problems.",
    overdose: "Excessive vitamin E intake from dietary sources and supplements can lead to vitamin E toxicity, also known as hypervitaminosis E. Symptoms of vitamin E toxicity may include nausea, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fatigue, and hemorrhage. Long-term excess intake of vitamin E can interfere with blood clotting and increase the risk of bleeding disorders.",
