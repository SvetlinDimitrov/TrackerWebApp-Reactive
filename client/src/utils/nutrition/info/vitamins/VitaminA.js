    description: "Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes in the body. It is essential for vision, immune function, skin health, growth, and development.",
    functions: {
        "Vision": "Vitamin A is necessary for the formation and maintenance of healthy vision, particularly in low-light conditions. It is a component of rhodopsin, a protein in the retina that enables the eyes to detect light and facilitate visual perception. Adequate vitamin A levels are important for night vision, adaptation to darkness, and prevention of vision disorders such as night blindness and dry eyes.",
        "Immune Function": "Vitamin A is essential for immune system function and defense mechanisms. It supports the development and differentiation of immune cells such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages. Vitamin A also helps regulate inflammatory responses, pathogen clearance, and antibody production.",
        "Skin Health": "Vitamin A is important for skin health and integrity, playing a role in the growth, repair, and maintenance of epithelial tissues. It promotes skin cell turnover, collagen synthesis, and wound healing processes. Adequate vitamin A levels are necessary for healthy skin texture, hydration, and protection against environmental damage.",
        "Growth and Development": "Vitamin A is crucial for growth and development, particularly during fetal development, infancy, and childhood. It supports normal cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation in various tissues and organs, including the lungs, heart, kidneys, and skeletal system. Vitamin A deficiency during pregnancy can lead to developmental abnormalities and birth defects.",
        "Reproduction": "Vitamin A is involved in reproductive processes and fertility in both males and females. It plays a role in spermatogenesis, oocyte development, and embryonic implantation. Adequate vitamin A levels are important for reproductive health, hormone regulation, and pregnancy outcomes."

    sources: {
        "Animal Products": "Animal products such as liver, fish liver oil, egg yolks, and dairy products are rich dietary sources of vitamin A. They provide preformed vitamin A in the form of retinol and retinyl esters, which are readily absorbed and utilized by the body.",
        "Orange and Yellow Fruits": "Orange and yellow fruits such as mangoes, papayas, apricots, and cantaloupes contain beta-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A. Beta-carotene is converted to retinol in the body and serves as a major dietary source of provitamin A carotenoids.",
        "Dark Green Leafy Vegetables": "Dark green leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale, collard greens, and Swiss chard are rich in beta-carotene and other carotenoids. They provide significant amounts of provitamin A carotenoids along with fiber, vitamins, and minerals.",
        "Fortified Foods": "Certain foods such as fortified cereals, margarine, and dairy alternatives may be fortified with vitamin A or beta-carotene to enhance their nutritional value. Fortified foods can help increase vitamin A intake, particularly in populations at risk of deficiency."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of vitamin A varies by age, sex, and individual health status. For most adults, the recommended amount is approximately 700-900 micrograms of retinol activity equivalents (RAE) per day for men and 600-700 micrograms RAE per day for women. Pregnant and lactating women may have higher vitamin A requirements.",
    deficiency: "Vitamin A deficiency is a significant public health concern, particularly in developing countries with limited access to diverse diets. Symptoms of vitamin A deficiency may include night blindness, dry eyes, skin changes, impaired immunity, growth retardation, and reproductive abnormalities. Severe vitamin A deficiency can lead to xerophthalmia, a blinding eye disorder, and increased susceptibility to infections.",
    overdose: "Excessive vitamin A intake from supplements or fortified foods can lead to vitamin A toxicity or hypervitaminosis A. Symptoms of vitamin A toxicity may include nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, blurred vision, bone pain, liver damage, and birth defects. Chronic overconsumption of vitamin A supplements should be avoided, particularly during pregnancy.",
