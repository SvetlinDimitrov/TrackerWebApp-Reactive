    description: "Vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes in the body. It is essential for DNA synthesis, red blood cell formation, neurological function, and energy metabolism.",
    functions: {
        "DNA Synthesis": "Vitamin B12 is necessary for the synthesis and maintenance of DNA, the genetic material found in all cells. It serves as a cofactor for enzymes involved in the methylation of nucleotides, which is essential for DNA replication, repair, and gene expression. Cobalamin ensures the proper transmission of genetic information during cell division and growth.",
        "Red Blood Cell Formation": "Vitamin B12 plays a key role in red blood cell formation and maturation, supporting oxygen transport and delivery to tissues. It is involved in the synthesis of hemoglobin, the iron-containing protein in red blood cells that binds and carries oxygen. Cobalamin deficiency can lead to megaloblastic anemia, characterized by large, immature red blood cells.",
        "Neurological Function": "Vitamin B12 is essential for neurological function and nerve health, playing a role in nerve signaling, myelin sheath formation, and neurotransmitter synthesis. It is involved in the maintenance of nerve cells, axons, and synapses in the brain and peripheral nervous system. Cobalamin deficiency may lead to neurological symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and cognitive impairment.",
        "Energy Metabolism": "Vitamin B12 participates in energy metabolism by facilitating the conversion of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into energy. It serves as a cofactor for enzymes involved in the breakdown of amino acids and fatty acids, as well as the citric acid cycle. Cobalamin helps generate and transfer energy from nutrients to cells for vital cellular functions."

    sources: {
        "Animal Products": "Animal products such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy products are the primary dietary sources of vitamin B12. They provide cobalamin in significant amounts, along with high-quality protein, iron, zinc, and other essential nutrients.",
        "Fortified Foods": "Fortified foods such as breakfast cereals, plant-based milk alternatives, and nutritional yeast are often enriched with synthetic vitamin B12. These fortified foods can help individuals meet their daily cobalamin requirements, especially in populations with limited access to animal-derived foods.",
        "Supplements": "Vitamin B12 supplements, including oral tablets, sublingual lozenges, and intramuscular injections, are available for individuals with vitamin B12 deficiency or malabsorption disorders. These supplements contain cyanocobalamin or methylcobalamin, the two most common forms of vitamin B12 used in supplements."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of vitamin B12 varies by age, sex, and individual health status. For most adults, the recommended amount is approximately 2.4 micrograms per day. Pregnant and lactating women may require slightly higher doses of cobalamin to support fetal development and breastfeeding.",
    deficiency: "Vitamin B12 deficiency is relatively common, especially among older adults, vegetarians, vegans, and individuals with gastrointestinal disorders. Symptoms of cobalamin deficiency may include fatigue, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath, neurological symptoms such as numbness and tingling, and megaloblastic anemia. Untreated deficiency can lead to irreversible neurological damage.",
    overdose: "Excessive vitamin B12 intake from dietary sources and supplements is generally not associated with adverse effects, as cobalamin is water-soluble and excess amounts are excreted in urine. There are no known toxic effects of high-dose vitamin B12 supplementation. However, individuals with certain medical conditions such as kidney disease should consult their healthcare provider before taking vitamin B12 supplements.",
