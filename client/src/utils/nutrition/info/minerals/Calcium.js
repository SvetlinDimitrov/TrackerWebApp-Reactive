    description: "Calcium is an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes in the body. It is vital for maintaining strong bones and teeth, muscle function, nerve transmission, blood clotting, and hormone secretion.",
    functions: {
        "Bone and Teeth Structure": "Calcium is a major component of bones and teeth, providing strength and structure. It contributes to bone density and helps prevent osteoporosis and dental issues.",
        "Muscle Function": "Calcium is necessary for muscle contraction and relaxation. It regulates muscle tone, coordination, and movement.",
        "Nerve Transmission": "Calcium ions play a key role in transmitting nerve impulses throughout the body. They facilitate communication between nerve cells and enable various sensory and motor functions.",
        "Blood Clotting": "Calcium is essential for blood clotting (coagulation). It helps convert prothrombin into thrombin, which is necessary for the formation of blood clots to prevent excessive bleeding.",
        "Hormone Secretion": "Calcium is involved in the secretion of several hormones, including insulin, adrenaline, and parathyroid hormone. It helps regulate hormone release and function.",
        "Cell Signaling": "Calcium ions serve as second messengers in cell signaling pathways, regulating cellular processes such as gene expression, enzyme activity, and cell proliferation."
    },
    sources: {
        "Dairy Products": "Dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese are rich sources of calcium. They provide easily absorbable calcium along with other essential nutrients.",
        "Leafy Green Vegetables": "Dark green leafy vegetables such as kale, spinach, collard greens, and broccoli contain significant amounts of calcium. However, the absorption of calcium from plant-based sources may be lower due to the presence of oxalates and phytates.",
        "Fortified Foods": "Certain foods are fortified with calcium to enhance their nutritional value. These include fortified plant-based milks (e.g., almond milk, soy milk), orange juice, cereals, and tofu.",
        "Fish with Edible Bones": "Canned fish with edible bones, such as sardines and salmon, are good sources of calcium. Consuming these fish provides both calcium and omega-3 fatty acids."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of calcium varies by age, sex, and life stage. For adults aged 19-50, the recommended amount is 1000 mg per day. Women over 50 and men over 70 require 1200 mg per day. Adolescents, pregnant women, and breastfeeding women also have higher calcium needs.",
    deficiency: "Calcium deficiency can lead to health issues such as osteoporosis, characterized by weak and brittle bones, and osteopenia, a precursor to osteoporosis. In children, calcium deficiency can impair bone development and lead to rickets, a condition characterized by soft and weak bones.",
    overdose: "Excessive intake of calcium can lead to hypercalcemia, a condition characterized by high levels of calcium in the blood. Symptoms of calcium overdose may include nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, excessive thirst, frequent urination, muscle weakness, confusion, and fatigue. Long-term excessive intake of calcium supplements can increase the risk of kidney stones and cardiovascular problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional before taking high doses of calcium supplements.",
