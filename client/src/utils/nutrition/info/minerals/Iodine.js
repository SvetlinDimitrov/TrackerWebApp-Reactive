    description: "Iodine is an essential trace mineral that plays a crucial role in thyroid function, hormone synthesis, and overall metabolic regulation in the body.",
    functions: {
        "Thyroid Hormone Production": "Iodine is a key component of thyroid hormones, including thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). These hormones regulate metabolism, growth, development, and energy expenditure.",
        "Metabolic Regulation": "Thyroid hormones influence various metabolic processes in the body, including carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. They help maintain energy balance, body temperature, and cellular function.",
        "Brain Development": "Iodine is essential for normal brain development and cognitive function, particularly during fetal development and infancy. Adequate iodine intake during pregnancy and lactation is critical for optimal neurological outcomes in offspring.",
        "Reproductive Health": "Iodine plays a role in reproductive health and fertility by regulating hormone synthesis and signaling pathways. It is important for menstrual regularity, ovulation, and embryo implantation.",
        "Immune Function": "Iodine contributes to immune function and defense mechanisms by supporting the activity of immune cells and promoting the production of antibodies. Adequate iodine levels are important for optimal immune responses and resistance to infections."
    },
    sources: {
        "Seafood": "Seafood, particularly ocean fish and shellfish, is a rich dietary source of iodine. Fish such as cod, tuna, shrimp, and seaweed contain high levels of iodine due to bioaccumulation from seawater.",
        "Dairy Products": "Dairy products, including milk, yogurt, and cheese, provide iodine in varying amounts, depending on factors such as animal diet and processing methods. Some dairy products may be fortified with iodine for nutritional purposes.",
        "Iodized Salt": "Iodized salt is table salt that has been fortified with iodine to prevent iodine deficiency disorders. It is a common dietary source of iodine in regions where iodized salt is widely used in food preparation and manufacturing.",
        "Eggs": "Eggs are a good source of iodine, providing essential nutrients for overall health and development. Both the egg yolk and egg white contain iodine, along with other vitamins and minerals.",
        "Fruits and Vegetables": "Certain fruits and vegetables contain iodine in varying amounts, depending on soil iodine content and agricultural practices. Examples include potatoes, strawberries, and cranberries."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of iodine varies by age, sex, and life stage. For most adults, the recommended amount is approximately 150 micrograms per day. Pregnant and breastfeeding women have higher iodine requirements to support fetal and infant development.",
    deficiency: "Iodine deficiency can lead to thyroid disorders such as goiter, hypothyroidism, and cretinism, particularly in regions with low dietary iodine intake. Symptoms of iodine deficiency may include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and cognitive impairment.",
    overdose: "Excessive iodine intake, known as iodine toxicity, can occur from consuming high-dose iodine supplements or iodine-containing medications. Symptoms of iodine toxicity may include thyroid dysfunction, thyroid enlargement, and gastrointestinal upset.",
