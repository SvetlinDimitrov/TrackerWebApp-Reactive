    description: "Chloride is an essential mineral and electrolyte that plays a crucial role in maintaining fluid balance, acid-base balance, and cellular function in the body.",
    functions: {
        "Fluid Balance": "Chloride ions help maintain proper hydration and fluid balance within cells and tissues. They contribute to osmotic pressure and regulate the movement of water between compartments.",
        "Acid-Base Balance": "Chloride ions, along with sodium and bicarbonate, participate in the regulation of pH levels in the body. They help maintain the acid-base balance of bodily fluids, ensuring optimal physiological function.",
        "Digestion": "Chloride ions are involved in the production of hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the stomach, which is necessary for the digestion and breakdown of food. HCl helps activate digestive enzymes and facilitates nutrient absorption in the intestines.",
        "Nerve Function": "Chloride ions play a role in nerve transmission and muscle contraction. They help generate action potentials and electrical signals in neurons, allowing for communication between cells and tissues.",
        "Immune Response": "Chloride ions are involved in the immune response and defense mechanisms of the body. They help regulate the activity of immune cells and facilitate the transport of antibodies and immune factors."
    },
    sources: {
        "Table Salt (Sodium Chloride)": "The primary dietary source of chloride is table salt, or sodium chloride. Salt is commonly used as a seasoning and food preservative in various cuisines worldwide.",
        "Processed Foods": "Many processed and packaged foods contain added salt (sodium chloride) as a flavor enhancer and preservative. These foods include canned soups, sauces, condiments, snacks, and convenience meals.",
        "Dairy Products": "Some dairy products, such as cheese and yogurt, naturally contain chloride. However, their contribution to overall chloride intake is relatively small compared to salt and processed foods.",
        "Seafood": "Seafood, particularly ocean fish and shellfish, contains chloride as part of their natural composition. Consuming seafood can contribute to chloride intake along with other essential nutrients."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of chloride varies depending on factors such as age, sex, and overall health status. However, most adults require approximately 2300-2400 milligrams of chloride per day, which is equivalent to the amount found in about 1 teaspoon of salt.",
    deficiency: "Chloride deficiency is rare and usually occurs in conjunction with other electrolyte imbalances, such as hyponatremia (low sodium levels) or hypokalemia (low potassium levels). Symptoms of chloride deficiency may include dehydration, muscle weakness, fatigue, and irregular heartbeat.",
    overdose: "Excessive intake of chloride, primarily from high dietary salt intake, can lead to health issues such as hypertension (high blood pressure), fluid retention, and electrolyte imbalances. Individuals with certain medical conditions, such as kidney disease or heart failure, may be more sensitive to the effects of excess chloride.",
