    description: "Manganese is an essential trace mineral that plays a vital role in various physiological processes in the body. It is involved in antioxidant defense, bone formation, metabolism, and neurological function.",
    functions: {
        "Antioxidant Defense": "Manganese serves as a cofactor for several antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase, which help neutralize harmful free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells and tissues. Manganese-dependent antioxidants protect cells from oxidative damage and support overall antioxidant defense mechanisms.",
        "Bone Formation": "Manganese is essential for bone health and development, working synergistically with other minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium. It is involved in the synthesis of collagen and proteoglycans, two key components of bone tissue, cartilage, and connective tissues.",
        "Metabolism": "Manganese plays a role in energy metabolism and macronutrient utilization by serving as a cofactor for enzymes involved in carbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolism. It helps convert nutrients into usable energy (ATP) for cellular activities and supports metabolic processes in various tissues.",
        "Neurological Function": "Manganese is necessary for normal neurological function and neurotransmitter synthesis. It is involved in the production of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, which play key roles in mood regulation, cognition, and behavior.",
        "Reproductive Health": "Manganese contributes to reproductive health and fertility by supporting hormone synthesis and reproductive organ function. It is involved in the production of sex hormones such as estrogen and progesterone, as well as sperm production and maturation."
    },
    sources: {
        "Nuts and Seeds": "Nuts and seeds, including almonds, hazelnuts, pecans, and pumpkin seeds, are excellent dietary sources of manganese. They provide not only manganese but also healthy fats, protein, and other essential nutrients.",
        "Whole Grains": "Whole grains such as brown rice, oats, barley, and whole wheat products contain manganese in varying amounts. Consuming a variety of whole grains can contribute to overall manganese intake along with other essential nutrients.",
        "Legumes and Beans": "Legumes and beans, such as chickpeas, lentils, black beans, and kidney beans, are rich sources of manganese. They provide not only manganese but also dietary fiber, protein, and other vitamins and minerals.",
        "Leafy Green Vegetables": "Leafy green vegetables such as spinach, kale, Swiss chard, and collard greens are good dietary sources of manganese. They offer manganese along with other vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of manganese varies by age, sex, and individual health status. For most adults, the recommended amount is approximately 2.3-2.6 milligrams per day for males and 1.8-2.0 milligrams per day for females. Pregnant and lactating women may have higher manganese requirements.",
    deficiency: "Manganese deficiency is rare and typically occurs in conjunction with other nutrient deficiencies or underlying health conditions. Symptoms of manganese deficiency may include impaired growth and development, skeletal abnormalities, reproductive dysfunction, and neurological symptoms.",
    overdose: "Excessive manganese intake, known as manganese toxicity, can occur from chronic exposure to high levels of manganese in drinking water, occupational settings, or dietary supplements. Symptoms of manganese toxicity may include neurological symptoms such as tremors, muscle stiffness, and cognitive impairment.",
