    description: "Selenium is an essential trace mineral that plays a critical role in various physiological processes in the body. It is a component of selenoproteins, which have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-modulating properties.",
    functions: {
        "Antioxidant Defense": "Selenium is a key component of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidases (GPx) and thioredoxin reductases (TrxR), which help neutralize harmful free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells and tissues. Selenium-dependent antioxidants protect cells from oxidative damage and support overall antioxidant defense mechanisms.",
        "Thyroid Function": "Selenium is involved in thyroid hormone metabolism and synthesis, particularly in the conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3), the active form of thyroid hormone. Adequate selenium levels are necessary for optimal thyroid function and regulation of metabolic processes.",
        "Immune Function": "Selenium plays a role in immune function and defense mechanisms by supporting the activity of immune cells such as lymphocytes, macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells. Selenium helps regulate immune responses, inflammation, and pathogen clearance.",
        "Reproductive Health": "Selenium contributes to reproductive health and fertility by protecting sperm cells from oxidative damage and supporting male reproductive function. It is involved in sperm maturation, motility, and viability, as well as DNA integrity and fertilization.",
        "Cancer Prevention": "Selenium has been studied for its potential role in cancer prevention and risk reduction. Some research suggests that selenium may help protect against certain types of cancer by inhibiting tumor growth, promoting DNA repair, and modulating immune responses."
    },
    sources: {
        "Seafood": "Seafood, such as fish, shellfish, and crustaceans, is a rich dietary source of selenium, particularly in regions where the soil and water are selenium-rich. Fish like tuna, salmon, sardines, and shrimp contain selenium along with omega-3 fatty acids and protein.",
        "Brazil Nuts": "Brazil nuts are one of the richest food sources of selenium, providing exceptionally high levels of this mineral. Eating just one or two Brazil nuts per day can meet or exceed the recommended daily intake of selenium for most individuals.",
        "Meat and Poultry": "Meat and poultry, including beef, pork, chicken, and turkey, are good sources of selenium. They offer selenium along with high-quality protein, vitamins, and minerals, making them nutritious choices for overall health and well-being.",
        "Whole Grains": "Whole grains such as brown rice, oats, barley, and whole wheat products contain selenium in varying amounts. Consuming a variety of whole grains can contribute to overall selenium intake along with dietary fiber and other nutrients."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of selenium varies by age, sex, and individual health status. For most adults, the recommended amount is approximately 55-70 micrograms per day. Pregnant and lactating women may have slightly higher selenium requirements.",
    deficiency: "Selenium deficiency is rare in healthy individuals with balanced diets, as selenium is widely available in many foods. However, certain factors such as low soil selenium levels, poor dietary intake, and gastrointestinal disorders may increase the risk of deficiency. Symptoms of selenium deficiency may include muscle weakness, fatigue, hair loss, and compromised immune function.",
    overdose: "Excessive selenium intake, known as selenium toxicity or selenosis, can occur from chronic supplementation or environmental exposure to high levels of selenium. Symptoms of selenium toxicity may include gastrointestinal disturbances, hair and nail changes, neurological symptoms, and in severe cases, organ damage and death.",
