    description: "Copper is an essential trace mineral that plays a critical role in various physiological processes in the body. It is involved in energy production, connective tissue formation, iron metabolism, and antioxidant defense.",
    functions: {
        "Energy Production": "Copper is a cofactor for several enzymes involved in cellular respiration and energy production. It helps convert nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into usable energy (ATP) for cellular activities.",
        "Connective Tissue Formation": "Copper is necessary for the synthesis of collagen and elastin, two proteins that are essential for the formation and maintenance of connective tissues, including skin, bones, cartilage, and blood vessels.",
        "Iron Metabolism": "Copper plays a role in iron metabolism by facilitating the absorption of dietary iron from the intestines and its release from storage sites (e.g., liver, spleen). It helps convert ferrous iron (Fe2+) to ferric iron (Fe3+), which is essential for iron transport and utilization.",
        "Neurotransmitter Synthesis": "Copper is involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. It plays a role in neurotransmitter metabolism and signaling within the nervous system, affecting mood, cognition, and behavior.",
        "Antioxidant Defense": "Copper serves as a cofactor for superoxide dismutase (SOD), an antioxidant enzyme that helps neutralize harmful free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS). It helps protect cells and tissues from oxidative damage and supports overall antioxidant defense mechanisms."
    },
    sources: {
        "Shellfish and Organ Meats": "Shellfish, particularly oysters, are one of the richest dietary sources of copper. Organ meats such as liver and kidneys also contain significant amounts of copper, along with other essential nutrients.",
        "Nuts and Seeds": "Nuts and seeds, including almonds, cashews, sesame seeds, and pumpkin seeds, are good sources of copper. They provide not only copper but also healthy fats, protein, and other micronutrients.",
        "Whole Grains": "Whole grains such as wheat, barley, oats, and rice contain moderate amounts of copper. Consuming a variety of whole grains can contribute to overall copper intake along with other essential nutrients.",
        "Legumes and Beans": "Legumes and beans, such as lentils, chickpeas, and soybeans, are rich sources of copper. They provide not only copper but also dietary fiber, protein, and other vitamins and minerals."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of copper varies by age, sex, and individual health status. However, most adults require approximately 900 micrograms of copper per day. Pregnant and lactating women may have higher copper needs.",
    deficiency: "Copper deficiency is rare in healthy individuals and is primarily associated with inadequate dietary intake, malabsorption disorders, or excessive zinc supplementation. Symptoms of copper deficiency may include anemia, bone abnormalities, impaired immune function, and neurological disorders.",
    overdose: "Excessive intake of copper supplements or ingestion of contaminated food or water may lead to copper toxicity, known as copper poisoning. Symptoms of copper toxicity may include gastrointestinal upset, liver damage, kidney failure, and neurological symptoms.",
