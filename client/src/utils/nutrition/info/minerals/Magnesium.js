    description: "Magnesium is an essential mineral that plays a critical role in numerous physiological functions in the body. It is involved in energy metabolism, muscle and nerve function, bone health, and protein synthesis.",
    functions: {
        "Energy Metabolism": "Magnesium serves as a cofactor for enzymes involved in energy production and metabolism, including ATP synthesis and glycolysis. It helps convert nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into usable energy (ATP) for cellular activities.",
        "Muscle and Nerve Function": "Magnesium plays a key role in muscle contraction and relaxation, as well as nerve impulse transmission. It helps regulate calcium levels within cells, which is essential for proper muscle and nerve function.",
        "Bone Health": "Magnesium is important for bone health and density, working synergistically with calcium, vitamin D, and other minerals to maintain skeletal integrity. It helps regulate bone formation and resorption processes, influencing bone mineralization and turnover.",
        "Protein Synthesis": "Magnesium is involved in protein synthesis, the process by which cells build and repair proteins. It is required for the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and ribosomes, as well as the activation of amino acids for protein assembly.",
        "Heart Health": "Magnesium plays a role in cardiovascular health by supporting normal heart rhythm, blood pressure regulation, and vascular tone. It helps maintain the electrical stability of cardiac cells and blood vessel function.",
        "Glucose and Insulin Regulation": "Magnesium is involved in glucose metabolism and insulin signaling pathways, influencing blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity. Adequate magnesium levels may help reduce the risk of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes."

    sources: {
        "Leafy Green Vegetables": "Leafy green vegetables such as spinach, kale, Swiss chard, and collard greens are excellent dietary sources of magnesium. They provide magnesium along with other vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients.",
        "Nuts and Seeds": "Nuts and seeds, including almonds, cashews, peanuts, and pumpkin seeds, are rich sources of magnesium. They are convenient snack options that also provide healthy fats, protein, and fiber.",
        "Whole Grains": "Whole grains such as brown rice, quinoa, oats, and whole wheat products contain magnesium in varying amounts. Consuming a variety of whole grains can contribute to overall magnesium intake along with other essential nutrients.",
        "Legumes and Beans": "Legumes and beans, such as lentils, chickpeas, black beans, and kidney beans, are good sources of magnesium. They provide not only magnesium but also dietary fiber, protein, and other vitamins and minerals."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of magnesium varies by age, sex, and individual health status. For most adults, the recommended amount is approximately 310-420 milligrams per day for males and 270-320 milligrams per day for females. Pregnant and lactating women may have higher magnesium requirements.",
    deficiency: "Magnesium deficiency is relatively common and can lead to symptoms such as muscle cramps, fatigue, weakness, irritability, and abnormal heart rhythms. Chronic magnesium deficiency may increase the risk of osteoporosis, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.",
    overdose: "Excessive magnesium intake, known as magnesium toxicity, is rare and typically occurs from overuse of magnesium supplements or medications. Symptoms of magnesium toxicity may include diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and low blood pressure.",
