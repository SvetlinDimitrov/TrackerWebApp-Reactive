    description: "Sodium is an essential mineral and electrolyte that plays a critical role in various physiological processes in the body. It is involved in fluid balance, nerve transmission, muscle function, and blood pressure regulation.",
    functions: {
        "Fluid Balance": "Sodium helps regulate fluid balance within cells and tissues by controlling the movement of water and electrolytes across cell membranes. It maintains cellular hydration and osmotic pressure, which are essential for proper cellular function and hydration status.",
        "Nerve Transmission": "Sodium is essential for nerve impulse transmission and signaling processes. It helps maintain the electrical potential of cell membranes, allowing nerve cells to generate action potentials and communicate with other cells.",
        "Muscle Function": "Sodium plays a key role in muscle contraction and relaxation by influencing the movement of calcium ions within muscle cells. It helps regulate the excitability of muscle fibers and the generation of force during muscle contraction.",
        "Blood Pressure Regulation": "Sodium is a major determinant of blood pressure, particularly in its role as a component of extracellular fluid and blood plasma. It influences blood volume and vascular tone by affecting fluid retention, arterial stiffness, and the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)."
    },
    sources: {
        "Table Salt": "Table salt, or sodium chloride, is the primary dietary source of sodium for most people. It is commonly used as a seasoning and food preservative in cooking and food preparation. Processed and packaged foods also contain significant amounts of added sodium.",
        "Processed Foods": "Processed and packaged foods such as canned soups, frozen meals, snacks, condiments, and fast food are major sources of dietary sodium. These foods often contain high levels of added sodium in the form of salt, sodium bicarbonate, or sodium-containing additives.",
        "Dairy Products": "Dairy products such as milk, cheese, and yogurt naturally contain small amounts of sodium, although they are not significant contributors to overall sodium intake in most diets. Low-sodium or unsalted varieties of dairy products are available for individuals seeking to reduce sodium consumption.",
        "Natural Sources": "Certain natural foods such as vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds contain small amounts of sodium in their unprocessed form. However, the sodium content of these foods is relatively low compared to processed and packaged foods."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of sodium varies by age, sex, and individual health status. For most adults, the recommended amount is approximately 2,300-2,400 milligrams per day, which is equivalent to about one teaspoon of salt. However, excessive sodium intake is common in many populations due to the widespread availability of high-sodium processed foods.",
    deficiency: "Sodium deficiency, known as hyponatremia, is rare in healthy individuals with balanced diets, as sodium is widely available in many foods. However, certain factors such as excessive sweating, prolonged vomiting or diarrhea, and medical conditions affecting fluid balance may increase the risk of deficiency. Symptoms of sodium deficiency may include weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, headache, and altered mental status.",
    overdose: "Excessive sodium intake, known as sodium toxicity or hypernatremia, can occur from chronic consumption of high-sodium diets, particularly from processed and packaged foods. Sodium overload can lead to health problems such as hypertension, fluid retention, edema, and cardiovascular disease. Individuals with certain medical conditions such as kidney disease or heart failure may be more sensitive to the effects of excess sodium intake.",
