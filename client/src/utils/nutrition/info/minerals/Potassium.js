    description: "Potassium is an essential mineral and electrolyte that plays a critical role in various physiological processes in the body. It is involved in fluid balance, nerve transmission, muscle function, and cardiovascular health.",
    functions: {
        "Fluid Balance": "Potassium helps regulate fluid balance within cells and tissues by controlling the movement of water and electrolytes across cell membranes. It maintains cellular hydration and osmotic pressure, which are essential for proper cellular function.",
        "Nerve Transmission": "Potassium is essential for nerve impulse transmission and signaling processes. It helps maintain the electrical potential of cell membranes, allowing nerve cells to generate action potentials and communicate with other cells.",
        "Muscle Function": "Potassium plays a key role in muscle contraction and relaxation by regulating the excitability of muscle cells. It influences the activity of ion channels and pumps involved in muscle membrane potential and calcium release from intracellular stores.",
        "Heart Health": "Potassium is important for cardiovascular health and function, particularly in regulating heart rhythm and blood pressure. It helps maintain normal heart rate, rhythm, and contractility, and it counteracts the effects of sodium on blood pressure by promoting vasodilation and excretion of sodium by the kidneys."
    },
    sources: {
        "Fruits and Vegetables": "Fruits and vegetables are rich dietary sources of potassium, providing abundant amounts of this mineral along with vitamins, fiber, and antioxidants. Examples include bananas, oranges, tomatoes, potatoes, spinach, and avocados.",
        "Legumes and Beans": "Legumes and beans, such as lentils, chickpeas, black beans, and kidney beans, are excellent sources of potassium. They offer not only potassium but also dietary fiber, protein, and other essential nutrients.",
        "Dairy Products": "Dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and cheese contain potassium in varying amounts. They provide not only potassium but also calcium, vitamin D, and other nutrients important for bone health and overall well-being.",
        "Fish and Lean Meats": "Fish and lean meats, including salmon, tuna, chicken, and turkey, are good sources of potassium. They offer potassium along with high-quality protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and other nutrients."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of potassium varies by age, sex, and individual health status. For most adults, the recommended amount is approximately 2,600-3,400 milligrams per day. However, individual potassium needs may vary based on factors such as dietary habits, physical activity level, and health conditions.",
    deficiency: "Potassium deficiency, known as hypokalemia, can occur from inadequate dietary intake, excessive losses (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea), or medical conditions affecting potassium balance (e.g., kidney disorders). Symptoms of potassium deficiency may include muscle weakness, cramps, fatigue, irregular heart rhythm, and increased blood pressure.",
    overdose: "Excessive potassium intake, known as hyperkalemia, is rare in healthy individuals with normal kidney function, as excess potassium is excreted in urine. However, high intake of potassium supplements or potassium-containing medications may lead to hyperkalemia, which can cause symptoms such as muscle weakness, heart palpitations, and cardiac arrhythmias.",
