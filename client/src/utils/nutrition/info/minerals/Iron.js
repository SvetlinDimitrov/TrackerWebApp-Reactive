    description: "Iron is an essential mineral that is vital for various physiological functions in the body. It plays a key role in oxygen transport, energy metabolism, DNA synthesis, and immune function.",
    functions: {
        "Oxygen Transport": "Iron is a critical component of hemoglobin, a protein found in red blood cells that binds to oxygen molecules and transports them from the lungs to tissues throughout the body. Iron also helps form myoglobin, a protein in muscle cells that stores and releases oxygen for muscle contraction.",
        "Energy Metabolism": "Iron is involved in energy production and metabolism by serving as a cofactor for enzymes involved in cellular respiration and ATP synthesis. It helps convert nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into usable energy (ATP) for cellular activities.",
        "DNA Synthesis": "Iron is necessary for DNA synthesis and cell proliferation, particularly in rapidly dividing tissues such as bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract. It plays a role in cell growth, differentiation, and repair.",
        "Immune Function": "Iron is essential for optimal immune function and defense mechanisms. It is required for the proliferation and activity of immune cells, including lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils, which play key roles in immune surveillance, inflammation, and infection control.",
        "Neurotransmitter Synthesis": "Iron is involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, which are important for mood regulation, cognition, and behavior. Iron deficiency may affect neurotransmitter balance and contribute to neurological symptoms."
    },
    sources: {
        "Animal-Based Foods": "Animal-based foods are rich sources of heme iron, a highly bioavailable form of iron that is easily absorbed by the body. Examples include red meat, poultry, fish, and shellfish.",
        "Plant-Based Foods": "Plant-based foods contain non-heme iron, a form of iron that is less readily absorbed compared to heme iron. Good sources of non-heme iron include legumes, tofu, lentils, beans, spinach, and fortified cereals.",
        "Iron-Fortified Foods": "Certain foods are fortified with iron to enhance their nutritional value, particularly for individuals at risk of iron deficiency. Common examples include iron-fortified cereals, bread, pasta, and infant formula.",
        "Nuts and Seeds": "Nuts and seeds, such as almonds, cashews, pumpkin seeds, and sesame seeds, are good sources of iron, along with other essential nutrients such as protein, healthy fats, and fiber."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of iron varies by age, sex, and individual health status. For most adults, the recommended amount is approximately 8-18 milligrams per day, depending on factors such as age, sex, and life stage. Pregnant women have higher iron requirements to support fetal growth and development.",
    deficiency: "Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies worldwide and can lead to anemia, characterized by low hemoglobin levels and impaired oxygen transport. Symptoms of iron deficiency anemia may include fatigue, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath, and impaired cognitive function.",
    overdose: "Excessive iron intake, known as iron overload or hemochromatosis, can occur from chronic supplementation or inherited disorders of iron metabolism. Symptoms of iron overload may include abdominal pain, joint pain, fatigue, liver damage, and organ failure.",
