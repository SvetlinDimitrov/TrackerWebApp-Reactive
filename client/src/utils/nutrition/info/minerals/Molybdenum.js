    description: "Molybdenum is an essential trace mineral that plays a critical role in various physiological processes in the body. It is involved in enzymatic reactions, sulfur metabolism, and detoxification.",
    functions: {
        "Enzymatic Reactions": "Molybdenum serves as a cofactor for several enzymes, known as molybdoenzymes, that catalyze important biochemical reactions in the body. These enzymes are involved in processes such as amino acid metabolism, purine metabolism, and sulfite detoxification.",
        "Sulfur Metabolism": "Molybdenum is necessary for the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids such as cysteine and methionine. It participates in the conversion of sulfite to sulfate, a crucial step in sulfur metabolism and the detoxification of sulfite compounds.",
        "Detoxification": "Molybdenum plays a role in detoxification processes by facilitating the breakdown and elimination of harmful substances such as sulfites, which can accumulate in the body and cause adverse effects. It helps convert sulfite to sulfate, a less toxic form that can be excreted in urine.",
        "Uric Acid Metabolism": "Molybdenum is involved in the metabolism of purines, which are compounds found in foods and produced by the body. It helps convert purines to uric acid, which is then excreted from the body in urine. Adequate molybdenum levels may help prevent the buildup of uric acid and reduce the risk of gout."
    },
    sources: {
        "Legumes and Beans": "Legumes and beans, such as lentils, chickpeas, black beans, and kidney beans, are rich dietary sources of molybdenum. They provide not only molybdenum but also protein, fiber, and other essential nutrients.",
        "Whole Grains": "Whole grains such as barley, oats, buckwheat, and whole wheat products contain molybdenum in varying amounts. Consuming a variety of whole grains can contribute to overall molybdenum intake along with other essential nutrients.",
        "Nuts and Seeds": "Nuts and seeds, including sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, almonds, and peanuts, are good sources of molybdenum. They offer not only molybdenum but also healthy fats, protein, and other vitamins and minerals.",
        "Leafy Green Vegetables": "Leafy green vegetables such as spinach, kale, Swiss chard, and collard greens are dietary sources of molybdenum. They provide molybdenum along with other vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of molybdenum varies by age, sex, and individual health status. For most adults, the recommended amount is approximately 45-50 micrograms per day. Pregnant and lactating women may have slightly higher molybdenum requirements.",
    deficiency: "Molybdenum deficiency is rare and typically occurs in conjunction with other nutrient deficiencies or underlying health conditions. Symptoms of molybdenum deficiency may include impaired sulfur metabolism, neurological symptoms, and susceptibility to sulfite sensitivity reactions.",
    overdose: "Excessive molybdenum intake, known as molybdenum toxicity, is rare and usually only occurs from industrial exposure or environmental contamination. Symptoms of molybdenum toxicity may include diarrhea, gout-like symptoms, and impaired copper metabolism.",
