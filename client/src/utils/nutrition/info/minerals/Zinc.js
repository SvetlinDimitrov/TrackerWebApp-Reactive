    description: "Zinc is an essential trace mineral that plays a critical role in various physiological processes in the body. It is involved in immune function, protein synthesis, wound healing, DNA synthesis, and cell division.",
    functions: {
        "Immune Function": "Zinc is vital for immune system function and defense mechanisms. It helps regulate innate and adaptive immune responses, including the production and activity of immune cells such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages.",
        "Protein Synthesis": "Zinc is necessary for protein synthesis and metabolism, which are essential processes for growth, repair, and maintenance of tissues and organs. It is involved in the synthesis of enzymes, hormones, and structural proteins that play critical roles in cellular function.",
        "Wound Healing": "Zinc is important for wound healing and tissue repair processes. It supports skin integrity and regeneration by promoting cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation at the wound site. Zinc also helps maintain the structural integrity of connective tissues such as collagen and elastin.",
        "DNA Synthesis": "Zinc is essential for DNA synthesis and cell division, which are fundamental processes for growth, development, and reproduction. It is required for the activity of DNA polymerases, enzymes that catalyze the replication and repair of DNA molecules during cell replication and proliferation.",
        "Antioxidant Defense": "Zinc acts as an antioxidant and scavenger of free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells and tissues. It helps protect cells from oxidative damage and inflammation by supporting the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and metallothionein."

    sources: {
        "Meat and Poultry": "Meat and poultry, including beef, pork, chicken, and turkey, are rich dietary sources of zinc. They provide highly absorbable forms of zinc along with high-quality protein, vitamins, and minerals.",
        "Shellfish": "Shellfish such as oysters, crab, lobster, and mussels are among the best food sources of zinc. They contain high concentrations of bioavailable zinc along with other essential nutrients.",
        "Legumes and Beans": "Legumes and beans, such as lentils, chickpeas, black beans, and kidney beans, are good plant-based sources of zinc. They offer zinc along with dietary fiber, protein, and other nutrients.",
        "Nuts and Seeds": "Nuts and seeds, including pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, hemp seeds, and almonds, contain zinc in varying amounts. They are nutrient-dense sources of zinc along with healthy fats, protein, and vitamins."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of zinc varies by age, sex, and individual health status. For most adults, the recommended amount is approximately 8-11 milligrams per day for men and 6-8 milligrams per day for women. Pregnant and lactating women may have slightly higher zinc requirements.",
    deficiency: "Zinc deficiency is a common micronutrient deficiency worldwide, particularly in populations with inadequate dietary intake, poor absorption, or increased zinc losses. Symptoms of zinc deficiency may include impaired immune function, delayed wound healing, hair loss, loss of appetite, and growth retardation in children.",
    overdose: "Excessive zinc intake from dietary sources is rare and usually only occurs from chronic supplementation or accidental ingestion of zinc-containing products. However, high doses of zinc supplements can interfere with copper absorption and lead to adverse effects such as gastrointestinal disturbances, copper deficiency, and immune dysfunction.",
