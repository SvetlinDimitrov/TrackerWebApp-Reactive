    description: "Omega-6 fatty acids are a type of polyunsaturated fat that is essential for health. They play a crucial role in brain function, growth and development, and inflammation response.",
    functions: {
        "Cell Membrane Structure": "Omega-6 fatty acids are important components of cell membranes, contributing to their structure and flexibility. They help regulate what passes in and out of cells, ensuring proper cellular function.",
        "Inflammation Response": "Omega-6 fatty acids are precursors to signaling molecules called eicosanoids, which regulate inflammation, blood clotting, and immune response. While some inflammation is necessary for healing and defense against infection, excessive inflammation can lead to chronic diseases.",
        "Skin Health": "Omega-6 fatty acids are vital for maintaining healthy skin and hair. They help regulate skin barrier function, prevent water loss, and reduce inflammation associated with skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis.",
        "Hormone Production": "Omega-6 fatty acids are involved in the synthesis of hormones such as prostaglandins, which regulate various physiological processes including blood pressure, blood clotting, and immune response.",
        "Brain Function": "Omega-6 fatty acids, particularly arachidonic acid, are essential for brain development and function. They contribute to the structure of brain cell membranes and support cognitive processes such as learning and memory."
    },
    sources: {
        "Plant Oils": "Omega-6 fatty acids are abundant in plant-based oils, including soybean oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, and cottonseed oil. These oils are commonly used in cooking, salad dressings, and food processing.",
        "Nuts and Seeds": "Nuts and seeds, such as almonds, walnuts, pine nuts, pumpkin seeds, and sunflower seeds, are good sources of omega-6 fatty acids. They can be incorporated into snacks, baked goods, or sprinkled on salads and cereals.",
        "Meat and Poultry": "Animal-based foods, including meat, poultry, and eggs, contain omega-6 fatty acids, primarily in the form of arachidonic acid. Including moderate amounts of lean meat and poultry in the diet can contribute to omega-6 intake.",
        "Processed Foods": "Many processed and packaged foods contain oils high in omega-6 fatty acids, often as ingredients like soybean oil, corn oil, or sunflower oil. These foods include snacks, baked goods, fried foods, and convenience meals."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended intake of omega-6 fatty acids varies based on age, sex, and overall dietary pattern. However, it is generally recommended that omega-6 fatty acids contribute to around 5-10% of total daily calories. For most adults, this amounts to about 12-22 grams per day. Consuming a balanced diet with a variety of omega-6 sources can help meet dietary needs.",
    deficiency: "Omega-6 fatty acid deficiency is rare in healthy individuals with a balanced diet. However, inadequate intake of omega-6 fatty acids may lead to symptoms such as dry, itchy skin, hair loss, poor wound healing, and impaired immune function. Chronic deficiency may also increase the risk of inflammatory diseases and cognitive decline.",
    overdose: "Consuming too much omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids can promote inflammation in the body, which may contribute to chronic diseases such as heart disease, arthritis, and certain cancers. While omega-6 fatty acids are essential for health, an imbalance between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids can disrupt the body's inflammatory response and lead to adverse health effects. It's important to maintain a balanced ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids by reducing intake of processed foods high in vegetable oils and increasing consumption of omega-3-rich foods such as fatty fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts.",
