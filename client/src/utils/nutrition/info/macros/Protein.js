    description: "Proteins are large, complex molecules that play many critical roles in the body. They are made up of amino acids and are essential for the structure, function, and regulation of the body's tissues and organs. Proteins are involved in various bodily functions, including catalyzing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules.",
    functions: {
        "Building and Repairing Tissues": "Proteins are necessary for the growth and repair of tissues. They are a major component of muscles, bones, skin, and blood.",
        "Enzyme Production": "Proteins act as enzymes, which are catalysts that speed up biochemical reactions in the body. Enzymes are vital for digestion, energy production, blood clotting, and muscle contraction.",
        "Hormone Regulation": "Some proteins function as hormones, which help regulate bodily functions. Examples include insulin, which regulates blood sugar levels, and thyroid hormones, which regulate metabolism.",
        "Immune Function": "Proteins play a key role in the immune system by forming antibodies that help the body fight off infections.",
        "Transport and Storage": "Proteins help transport and store molecules. Hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells, transports oxygen throughout the body. Ferritin, another protein, stores iron."
    },
    sources: {
        "Animal Sources": "Animal-based foods such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy products are complete protein sources, meaning they provide all essential amino acids the body needs.",
        "Plant Sources": "Plant-based proteins can be found in beans, lentils, soy products, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. While some plant proteins may lack one or more essential amino acids, consuming a variety of plant proteins can provide a complete amino acid profile.",
        "Protein Supplements": "Protein supplements, such as whey, casein, and plant-based powders, can help individuals meet their protein needs, especially athletes and those with higher protein requirements."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of protein varies based on age, sex, and level of physical activity. The general recommendation is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight for adults. For example, an adult who weighs 70 kg (154 lbs) should consume about 56 grams of protein per day. Higher protein intake may be necessary for athletes, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and older adults to maintain muscle mass and overall health.",
    deficiency: "Protein deficiency can lead to various health issues, including muscle wasting, weakened immune function, and edema. In severe cases, protein-energy malnutrition conditions such as kwashiorkor and marasmus can occur, particularly in children. Symptoms of protein deficiency include fatigue, hair loss, delayed wound healing, and loss of muscle mass.",
    overdose: "Consuming excessive amounts of protein, particularly from animal sources, can strain the kidneys and may increase the risk of kidney damage or dysfunction, especially in individuals with pre-existing kidney conditions. Additionally, high-protein diets may lead to dehydration, as the kidneys require more water to metabolize and excrete excess nitrogen from protein breakdown. Overconsumption of protein supplements can also cause gastrointestinal discomfort, including bloating, gas, and diarrhea. It's important to maintain a balanced diet and consult with a healthcare professional before significantly increasing protein intake.",
