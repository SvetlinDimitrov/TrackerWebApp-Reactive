    description: "Trans fat, also known as trans-fatty acids, are a type of unsaturated fat that occur naturally in small amounts in some foods, but are primarily produced through the hydrogenation of vegetable oils. Trans fat has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease when consumed in excess.",
    functions: {
        "Energy Source": "Trans fat provides the body with energy, containing 9 calories per gram. It serves as a concentrated source of fuel for cellular activities and bodily functions, similar to other fats.",
        "Food Texture and Flavor": "Trans fat contributes to the texture, flavor, and mouthfeel of processed foods. It enhances the palatability and shelf life of foods like baked goods, fried foods, margarine, and processed snacks.",
        "Food Processing": "Trans fat is commonly used in food processing and manufacturing due to its stability at high temperatures and long shelf life. It helps improve the texture, consistency, and appearance of various food products.",
        "Preservative": "Trans fat acts as a preservative in some food products, extending their shelf life and reducing the risk of spoilage. It helps maintain the freshness and quality of packaged and processed foods over time."
    },
    sources: {
        "Partially Hydrogenated Oils": "The primary source of artificial trans fat in the diet is partially hydrogenated oils, which are produced through an industrial process that adds hydrogen to liquid vegetable oils to make them solid at room temperature. Partially hydrogenated oils are used in many processed and packaged foods, including margarine, shortening, baked goods, fried foods, and snack foods.",
        "Animal Products": "Small amounts of naturally occurring trans fat can be found in animal-based foods such as meat and dairy products, but these contribute less to overall trans fat intake compared to processed foods.",
        "Fried Foods": "Foods that are fried or deep-fried in partially hydrogenated oils may contain significant amounts of trans fat. These include fried chicken, French fries, doughnuts, and other fried snacks.",
        "Processed Foods": "Many processed and packaged foods contain added trans fat in the form of partially hydrogenated oils or hydrogenated fats. These foods include baked goods, snack foods, frozen dinners, microwave popcorn, and margarine."
    },
    dailyIntake: "Dietary guidelines recommend minimizing trans fat intake as much as possible due to its detrimental effects on health. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that trans fat intake be limited to less than 1% of total energy intake, which is equivalent to less than 2 grams of trans fat per day in a 2,000-calorie diet. In many countries, efforts have been made to reduce or eliminate trans fat from the food supply through regulations and industry initiatives.",
    deficiency: "Trans fat deficiency is not a recognized health concern because the body does not require trans fat for essential physiological functions. In fact, reducing trans fat intake is associated with improved cardiovascular health and reduced risk of chronic diseases.",
    overdose: "Consuming excessive amounts of trans fats can increase the risk of various health problems, including cardiovascular disease. Trans fat overdose may lead to elevated levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol and decreased levels of HDL (good) cholesterol, contributing to the development of heart disease and stroke. Additionally, trans fats have been linked to inflammation, insulin resistance, and other metabolic disorders. It's recommended to limit intake of trans fats by avoiding processed foods, fried foods, and commercially baked goods that contain partially hydrogenated oils.",
