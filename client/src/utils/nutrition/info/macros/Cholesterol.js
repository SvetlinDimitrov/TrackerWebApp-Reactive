    description: "Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance found in every cell of the body. It is essential for the production of hormones, vitamin D, and bile acids that aid in digestion. Cholesterol is primarily produced by the liver, but it can also be obtained from certain foods.",
    functions: {
        "Cell Membrane Structure": "Cholesterol is a key component of cell membranes, providing stability and fluidity. It helps regulate what substances can pass in and out of cells, ensuring proper cellular function.",
        "Hormone Production": "Cholesterol is a precursor for the synthesis of steroid hormones, including cortisol, aldosterone, estrogen, and testosterone. These hormones play crucial roles in metabolism, stress response, reproduction, and growth.",
        "Vitamin D Synthesis": "Cholesterol is converted into vitamin D in the skin upon exposure to sunlight. Vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption, bone health, immune function, and overall well-being.",
        "Bile Acid Synthesis": "Cholesterol is used to produce bile acids in the liver, which are necessary for the digestion and absorption of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins. Bile acids help emulsify fats, making them easier to digest and absorb in the intestines."
    },
    sources: {
        "Dietary Sources": "Cholesterol is found in animal-based foods such as meat, poultry, eggs, dairy products, and seafood. Organ meats like liver and kidney contain particularly high amounts of cholesterol.",
        "Saturated and Trans Fats": "Foods high in saturated and trans fats can increase cholesterol levels in the blood. These include fatty cuts of meat, processed meats, full-fat dairy products, butter, lard, and tropical oils like coconut oil and palm oil.",
        "Healthy Fats and Fiber": "Eating a diet rich in unsaturated fats (found in nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil) and fiber (found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes) can help lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease.",
        "Processed Foods": "Many processed and packaged foods contain added cholesterol, especially those made with hydrogenated oils, margarine, and partially hydrogenated fats. These foods include baked goods, fried foods, snacks, and convenience meals."
    },
    dailyIntake: "There is no recommended daily intake for cholesterol because the liver produces enough cholesterol to meet the body's needs. However, dietary guidelines recommend limiting dietary cholesterol intake to less than 300 milligrams per day for most people. Individuals with heart disease or high cholesterol levels may need to further restrict their cholesterol intake.",
    deficiency: "Cholesterol deficiency is not a recognized health concern because the body can produce all the cholesterol it needs. However, extremely low levels of cholesterol may be associated with certain health conditions or diseases.",
    overdose: "Consuming excessive amounts of dietary cholesterol can contribute to elevated levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol in the blood, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke. While dietary cholesterol itself isn't inherently harmful, it's often found in foods high in saturated and trans fats, which have a more significant impact on cholesterol levels. Additionally, individuals with certain genetic conditions, such as familial hypercholesterolemia, may be more sensitive to dietary cholesterol intake. It's important to focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources while limiting intake of high-cholesterol foods like egg yolks, organ meats, and full-fat dairy products to support heart health.",
