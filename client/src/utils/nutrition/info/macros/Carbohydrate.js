    description: "Carbohydrates are one of the main types of nutrients and serve as the primary source of energy for the body. They are found in a wide variety of foods and are essential for proper bodily function. Carbohydrates are classified into three main types: sugars, starches, and fibers. Simple carbohydrates include sugars found in fruits, vegetables, and milk, while complex carbohydrates include starches and fibers found in whole grains, legumes, and vegetables.",
    functions: {
        "Energy Production": "Carbohydrates are broken down into glucose, which is used by the body as a primary source of energy. This energy is vital for all bodily functions and physical activity.",
        "Brain Function": "Glucose derived from carbohydrates is the main energy source for the brain, supporting cognitive functions and overall mental performance.",
        "Digestive Health": "Dietary fiber, a type of carbohydrate, helps regulate the digestive system by promoting regular bowel movements and preventing constipation. It also supports a healthy gut microbiome.",
        "Sparing Protein": "Adequate carbohydrate intake prevents the body from using protein as an energy source, allowing protein to be used for its primary functions such as muscle repair and immune function.",
        "Fat Metabolism": "Carbohydrates are necessary for fat metabolism. Without enough carbohydrates, the body cannot efficiently burn fat, leading to the production of ketones."
    },
    sources: {
        "Natural Sources": "Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and dairy products are natural sources of carbohydrates. These foods provide essential vitamins, minerals, and fibers along with carbohydrates.",
        "Processed Foods": "Processed foods such as bread, pasta, cereals, and baked goods often contain added sugars and refined grains. These sources can contribute to excessive carbohydrate intake and may lack nutritional value compared to whole food sources.",
        "Sugars": "Natural sugars are found in fruits (fructose), vegetables, and dairy products (lactose). Added sugars are found in sweets, soft drinks, and many processed foods."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The daily intake of carbohydrates varies based on age, sex, and level of physical activity. Generally, carbohydrates should make up about 45-65% of total daily calories. For a person consuming a 2,000 calorie diet, this amounts to 225-325 grams of carbohydrates per day. It's recommended to focus on complex carbohydrates and natural sources while limiting added sugars.",
    deficiency: "A deficiency in carbohydrates can lead to low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia), resulting in symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and irritability. Severe carbohydrate deficiency can cause ketosis, where the body breaks down fat for energy, leading to a buildup of ketones. Chronic low carbohydrate intake can also impair physical and mental performance.",
    overdose: "Consuming excessive amounts of carbohydrates, especially refined carbohydrates and sugars, can contribute to weight gain, insulin resistance, and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Diets high in refined carbohydrates can cause rapid spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels, leading to fluctuations in energy levels and increased hunger. Additionally, excess carbohydrate intake may promote the storage of fat in the body, particularly around the abdomen. It's important to focus on consuming complex carbohydrates from whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes, while limiting intake of refined carbohydrates and sugary foods and beverages to maintain overall health and well-being.",
