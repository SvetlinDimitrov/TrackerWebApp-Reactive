    description: "Saturated fat is a type of fat that is solid at room temperature. It is found in various foods, including animal products and some plant-based oils. Saturated fat has been associated with an increased risk of heart disease when consumed in excess.",
    functions: {
        "Energy Source": "Saturated fat provides the body with energy, containing 9 calories per gram. It serves as a concentrated source of fuel for cellular activities and bodily functions.",
        "Cell Membrane Structure": "Saturated fat is a component of cell membranes, contributing to their structure and stability. It helps maintain the integrity of cell membranes and regulates what substances can pass in and out of cells.",
        "Hormone Production": "Saturated fat is involved in the synthesis of steroid hormones, including cortisol, aldosterone, estrogen, and testosterone. These hormones play important roles in metabolism, stress response, reproduction, and growth.",
        "Vitamin Absorption": "Saturated fat is necessary for the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) in the intestine. It helps dissolve and transport these vitamins from the digestive tract to various tissues and organs.",
        "Flavor and Texture": "Saturated fat contributes to the flavor, texture, and mouthfeel of foods. It enhances the palatability and sensory appeal of many dishes, particularly baked goods, dairy products, and fried foods."
    },
    sources: {
        "Animal Products": "Saturated fat is abundant in animal-based foods such as fatty cuts of meat, poultry skin, high-fat dairy products (whole milk, cheese, butter), lard, and fatty meats like bacon and sausage.",
        "Processed Foods": "Many processed and packaged foods contain added saturated fat, often in the form of hydrogenated oils, palm oil, or coconut oil. These foods include baked goods, fried foods, snacks, processed meats, and convenience meals.",
        "Coconut and Palm Oil": "Coconut oil and palm oil are plant-based sources of saturated fat. They are commonly used in cooking, baking, and food processing due to their stability at high temperatures and long shelf life.",
        "Certain Plant Foods": "Some plant-based foods naturally contain saturated fat, including coconut, palm kernel, and cocoa butter. Nuts and seeds, such as macadamia nuts and chia seeds, also contain small amounts of saturated fat."
    },
    dailyIntake: "Dietary guidelines recommend limiting saturated fat intake to less than 10% of total daily calories. For most adults, this amounts to no more than 22 grams of saturated fat per day in a 2,000-calorie diet. Consuming a diet low in saturated fat and replacing it with unsaturated fats (such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats) can help reduce the risk of heart disease.",
    deficiency: "Saturated fat deficiency is not a recognized health concern because the body can produce saturated fat from other nutrients. However, consuming an excessive amount of saturated fat, especially in combination with a high-calorie diet and sedentary lifestyle, can contribute to weight gain, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.",
    overdose: "Excessive consumption of saturated fats can contribute to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease by raising levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol in the blood. Diets high in saturated fats may also lead to weight gain, insulin resistance, and inflammation, all of which are risk factors for heart disease and other chronic conditions. It's recommended to limit intake of saturated fats by choosing lean protein sources, opting for plant-based fats such as avocado and nuts, and reducing consumption of high-fat dairy products and fatty meats.",
