    description: "Water is a vital substance that is essential for life. It makes up a significant portion of the human body and is involved in numerous physiological processes. Water is required for hydration, nutrient transport, temperature regulation, waste removal, and many other functions.",
    functions: {
        "Hydration": "Water is the primary component of body fluids, including blood, lymph, and digestive juices. It helps maintain fluid balance in the body and prevents dehydration, which can lead to fatigue, dizziness, and other health problems.",
        "Nutrient Transport": "Water serves as a medium for transporting nutrients, such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals, to cells throughout the body. It facilitates the absorption and distribution of nutrients essential for growth, repair, and energy production.",
        "Temperature Regulation": "Water plays a crucial role in regulating body temperature through processes like sweating and evaporation. It helps dissipate heat generated during physical activity or in response to high environmental temperatures, preventing overheating and heat-related illnesses.",
        "Digestion and Waste Removal": "Water is necessary for the digestion and absorption of food in the gastrointestinal tract. It softens and liquefies food, aids in the breakdown of nutrients, and facilitates the passage of waste products through the intestines for excretion.",
        "Joint Lubrication": "Water provides lubrication to joints, cartilage, and connective tissues, reducing friction and cushioning against impact. It helps maintain joint flexibility and mobility, preventing discomfort and stiffness."
    },
    sources: {
        "Drinking Water": "The primary source of water for humans is drinking water obtained from various sources, including tap water, bottled water, and filtered water. It is important to consume an adequate amount of clean, safe drinking water each day to meet hydration needs.",
        "Food": "Many foods, particularly fruits and vegetables, contain high water content and contribute to overall hydration. Foods like cucumbers, watermelon, oranges, strawberries, and lettuce are excellent sources of dietary water.",
        "Beverages": "In addition to water, other beverages like herbal teas, fruit juices, milk, and sports drinks can contribute to hydration. However, it's important to choose beverages without added sugars or excessive caffeine, which can have negative effects on health.",
        "Metabolic Processes": "Water is produced as a byproduct of metabolic processes in the body, such as cellular respiration and oxidation of macronutrients. While metabolic water contributes to overall hydration, it is not a significant source compared to fluid intake."
    },
    dailyIntake: "The recommended daily intake of water varies based on age, sex, body weight, physical activity level, climate, and other factors. However, a general guideline is to consume about 8 glasses (64 ounces) of water per day for adults, although individual needs may vary. Thirst, urine color, and urine frequency can be indicators of hydration status.",
    deficiency: "Dehydration occurs when the body loses more water than it takes in, leading to an imbalance in fluid levels. Mild dehydration can cause symptoms like thirst, dry mouth, fatigue, and dark urine. Severe dehydration can be life-threatening and may require medical intervention.",
    overdose: "Overhydration, or drinking too much water, can lead to a condition known as water intoxication or hyponatremia. This occurs when the balance of electrolytes in the body, particularly sodium, is disrupted by an excess of water. Symptoms of water overdose may include nausea, vomiting, headaches, confusion, seizures, and in severe cases, coma or death. It's essential to drink water in moderation and pay attention to your body's thirst signals.",
