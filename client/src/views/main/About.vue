    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">About Me</h1>
    <p class="mb-4">This application is created for everyone like me, who is passionate about health and understands the meaning of the phrase "food is fuel." My goal is to help people easily understand what nutrients are, provide basic knowledge about them, and also enable users to track their intake.</p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Main Functions</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
      <li>Provide easy-to-understand information about nutrients (please don't take it as 100% accurate, as everyone can make mistakes).</li>
      <li>Allows you to track how many calories you need, how many you have consumed, the nutrients you have taken in, and more. The app supports tracking of 42 different nutrients, which I believe is sufficient.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4">The application is inspired by MyFitnessPal but is completely free. Currently, the app is in early release, so there may be bugs that I have missed. If you notice any issues, please drop me a message at <a href="mailto:nutriguidebuddy@gmail.com" class="text-blue-500 underline">nutriguidebuddy@gmail.com</a>. Since the app is in early access, the styling is minimal and does not support responsive features.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">This will not be the only version; over time, I will work more on the site and improve it. To all the developers out there, I welcome any helpâ€”the project is open source, and you can find it here: <a href="https://github.com/SvetlinDimitrov/TrackerWebAppProject/tree/main/reactive-version" class="text-blue-500 underline" target="_blank">GitHub Link</a>.</p>    <p>Thank you very much in advance, and I hope you enjoy it.</p>
